<p>A nice lockdown project has been rebuilding my fixed gear bike, not that
   there is anywhere to go on it.</p><br>

<p>Going to a fancy school near Herne Hill Velodrome meant PE could be in the
  form of track cycling. Inspired by the local
  <a href="https://youtu.be/lVmmYMwFj1I">hipsters</a> I put together a beautiful
  blue machine and commuted to school on it every day, as well as racing on
  the track once/twice a week. However, when I went away to university it was
  left behind in the shed, and the aluminium seat post and aluminium frame
  all but became one piece.
