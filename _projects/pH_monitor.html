<p>
The pH of the medium a plant is grown in can have a large impact on its growth. This device is a simple pH controller for a hydroponic plant set up.

The brain of the operation is a PyBoard microcontroller. Any microcontroller would do, but I prefer them to your typical arduino uno/nano for several reasons. First I am most comfortable in python, and can get more done quickly, second it has a built in SD card for data storage, third, and most importantly, it has a REPL. The REPL allows instance access  to the peripherals, making prototyping, testing and bug-hunting much easier.

I found all of these parts on ebay for a total less than Â£50. I have avoided exact part names here because they don't matter, but feel free to send me an email for further guidance. To keep things neat you will also want a box to put them in, I 3D printed one, but any box you can cut some holes in will do.
