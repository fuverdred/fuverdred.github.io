ALTA is a device for freeze/thaw cycling samples. In my case, usually water and a suspension of K-feldspar, a mineral dust which is an efficient ice nucleator. It is a cheap and simple device to make, and requires no human interaction once it has been set going, making it an ideal device for ice nucleation experiments.
