<h2>About</h2>

<p>
  Having finished a physics PhD I am looking to move into software development. Currently most proficient in Python, but with a background in C and learning Clojure. I am also interested in electronics, I have a few projects in mind for when I finally invest in a 3D printer. You can find some of my programming/electronics projects on this site, or on my <a href="https://github.com/fuverdred">github</a>.
</p>

<p>
  I am also interested in cryptic crosswords, both writing and solving them. You can find my puzzles on <a href="https://mycrossword.co.uk/Grub">mycrossword.co.uk</a> or <a href="https://github.com/fuverdred/Crossword-Filler/tree/master/Compiled%20Crosswords">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
  I am also a keen cyclist, for transport and exercise (and for entertainment I watch pro cycling). I am mostly a roadie, but have a rigid singlespeed mountain bike for trundling around the local trails, and a fixed gear bicycle for getting around town.
